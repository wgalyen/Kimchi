# Troubleshooting Guide

This document describes common edge-cases and workarounds for checking links to various sites. \
Please add your own findings and send us a pull request if you can.

## GitHub Rate Limiting

GitHub has a quite aggressive rate limiter. \
If you're seeing errors like:

```
GitHub token not specified. To check GitHub links reliably, use `--github-token` flag / `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var.
```

That means you're getting rate-limited. As per the message, you can make kimchi \
use a GitHub personal access token to circumvent this.

For more details, see ["GitHub token" section in README.md](https://github.com/wgalyen/kimchi#github-token).

## Unexpected Status Codes

Some websites don't respond with a `200` (OK) status code. \
Instead they might send `204` (No Content), `206` (Partial Content), or
[something else entirely](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418).

If you run into such issues you can work around that by providing a custom \
list of accepted status codes, such as `--accept 200,204,206`.

## Website Expects Custom Headers

Some sites expect one or more custom headers to return a valid response. \
For example, crates.io expects a `Accept: text/html` header or else it \
will [return a 404](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/788).

To fix that you can pass additional headers like so: `--headers "accept=text/html"`. \
You can use that argument multiple times to add more headers. \
Or, you can accept all content/MIME types: `--headers "accept=*/*"`.

See more info about the Accept header
[over at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept).
